# Creative Services Agreement

Between myself, [company name]  
and you, [customer name] 

## Summary 

I’ll always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What I do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;

You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] are hiring myself ([company name]) located at [company address] to [design and develop a web site] for the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence. Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.

## What do both parties agree to do? 

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organization. You’ll give me everything I need when I need it and in the format I need it in. You’ll review my work and provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

*Me:* I have the experience and ability to do every I’ve agreed to with you and I’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. I’ll work to meet every deadline that’s set and will maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.

## Getting down to the nitty gritty 

### Research & strategy

I conduct research on your potential users (User Research) and create documents that communicate a summary of the research along with my opinions and recommendations on how the research impacts the design and direction of the website.

### Design 

I create look-and-feel designs and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. I create designs iteratively and predominantly use HTML and CSS so I won’t waste time mocking up every template as a static visual. I may use static visuals to indicate a look-and-feel direction (color, texture and typography.)

You’ll have plenty of opportunities to review my work and provide feedback. I’ll share my working Dropbox with you and have regular, possibly daily contact. If, at any stage, you’re not happy with the direction my work is taking, you’ll pay me in full for everything I’ve produced up to that time and cancel this contract.

### Text content 

I give my opinion on effective content structure and text copy to put in the design but I’m not responsible for writing or inputing any text copy. If you’d like me to write new content or input text for you, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Graphics & photographs 

You should supply graphic files in an editable, digital vector format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, I can suggest stock libraries. If you’d like me to search for photographs for you, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

I deliver web page types developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive JavaScript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviors.

### Browser testing

Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

### Desktop browser testing

I test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), and Mozilla Firefox. I’ll implement a single column design for older versions of Internet Explorer and I won’t test in other older browsers unless you specify otherwise. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Mobile browser testing

Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. I test my work in:

**iOS:** Safari, Google Chrome  
**Android 4.x:** Google Chrome and Firefox

I currently don’t test Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, Windows Phone or other mobile browsers. If you need me to test using these, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Technical support

I don’t run a website hosting company so I don’t offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don’t, I can set up an account for you at one of my preferred hosting providers, plus a basic setup of statistics software such as Google Analytics or Visual Website Optimizer. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will be up to you.

### Changes & revisions 

I know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your earliest ideas. We don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time I estimate I’ll need to accomplish everything you’ve told me you want to achieve, but I’m happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as I’ll provide a separate estimate and timeline for that.

### Legal stuff 

I can’t guarantee that my work will be error-free and so I can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised me of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.


### Copyrights 

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by you, or you have permission to use them.

Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You’ll own the visual elements that I create for this project. I’ll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as I’m not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them. 

I’ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and I’ll license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.

I like to show off my work and share what I’ve learned with other people, so I reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of my portfolio and to write about it on websites, on social media, in magazine articles, and in books.

### Payments 

I’m sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that I send you promptly. As I’m also sure you’ll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule.

[Payment schedule]

### But where’s all the horrible small print? 

Just like a parking ticket, you can’t transfer this contract to anyone else without my permission. This contract stays in place and does not need to be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place. 

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of courts in the United States of America.
